# Auction_Contract
The Auction Smart Contract is a decentralized application (DApp) written in the Solidity programming language for use on blockchain platforms such as Ethereum. 


## Features

- Bidding Functionality: Users can place bids, and each bid must exceed the current highest bid.
- Integration: Enables bidding with a specific ERC-20 token, providing flexibility.
- Ownership Control: Only the owner can end the auction and claim the winning bid.
- Auction Ending: The auction ends automatically after a specified duration, transferring the winning bid to the owner.
